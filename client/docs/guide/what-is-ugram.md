# What is Ugram?

Ugram is a social network that allows users to share photos with their friends. It is a clone of Instagram, but with a few differences. The main difference is that Ugram is a university project, and as such, it is not meant to be used by the general public. It is meant to be used by the students of Université Laval, and as such, it is only available to students of Université Laval.
